## ðŸ¦‡ Shaders

- **[ACNet](https://github.com/TianZerL/ACNetGLSL/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** - ACNet is a CNN algorithm, implemented by [Anime4KCPP](https://github.com/TianZerL/Anime4KCPP), it aims to provide both high-quality and high-performance.

- **[FSRCNN](https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases)** - Prescaler based on layered convolutional networks.
    
-   **[SSimDownscaler, SSimSuperRes, Krig, Adaptive Sharpen, etc.](https://gist.github.com/igv)**
    
    -   **[SSimDownscaler](https://gist.github.com/igv/36508af3ffc84410fe39761d6969be10)** - Perceptually based downscaler.
    -   **[SSimSuperRes](https://gist.github.com/igv/2364ffa6e81540f29cb7ab4c9bc05b6b)** - The aim of this shader is to make corrections to the image upscaled by mpv built-in scaler (removes ringing artifacts, restores original sharpness, etc).
    -   **[Krig](https://gist.github.com/igv/a015fc885d5c22e6891820ad89555637)** - Chroma scaler that uses luma information for high quality upscaling.
