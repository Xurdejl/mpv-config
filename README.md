## 🌨️ Shaders

- **[FSRCNN](https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases)** - Prescaler based on layered convolutional networks.
    
-   **[SSimDownscaler, SSimSuperRes, Krig, Adaptive Sharpen, etc.](https://gist.github.com/igv)**
    
    -   **[SSimDownscaler](https://gist.github.com/igv/36508af3ffc84410fe39761d6969be10)** - Perceptually based downscaler.
    -   **[SSimSuperRes](https://gist.github.com/igv/2364ffa6e81540f29cb7ab4c9bc05b6b)** - The aim of this shader is to make corrections to the image upscaled by mpv built-in scaler (removes ringing artifacts, restores original sharpness, etc).
    -   **[Krig](https://gist.github.com/igv/a015fc885d5c22e6891820ad89555637)** - Chroma scaler that uses luma information for high quality upscaling.

## 🔮 Scripts

- **[hayase-osc](./scripts/hayase-osc.lua)** - My custom osc fork, designed to look and feel like hayase.watch’s ui *(forked from [ModernZ](https://github.com/Samillion/ModernZ))*.

- **[evafast](https://github.com/po5/evafast)** - Fast-forwarding and seeking on a single key, with quality of life features like a slight slowdown when subtitles are shown.

- **[silentskip](./scripts/silentskip.lua)** - Effortlessly skip episode openings with a simple TAB press. *(Forked from [skiptosilence.lua](https://github.com/dyphire/mpv-config/blob/master/scripts/skiptosilence.lua))*

- **[thumbfast](https://github.com/po5/thumbfast)** - High-performance on-the-fly thumbnailer script for mpv.

- **[webm](https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm)** - Quickly create video clips.
